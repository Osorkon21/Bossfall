SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

    - These instructions are for Windows, they may vary slightly depending on your OS.

    - Unzip this folder to your operating system (location doesn't matter).

    - Put the bossfall.dfmod file in DaggerfallUnity's StreamingAssets/Mods folder.

    - Optionally, right-click on the StreamingAssets folder included in this folder, select COPY.

    - Right-click on DaggerfallUnity's StreamingAssets folder, PASTE Bossfall's StreamingAssets folder here.

    - Select YES when prompted to overwrite files (this removes Assassin bosses from easy non-dungeon vanilla quests).

    - Make sure to look at Bossfall's Settings page when you start up DFU, I suggest using the Recommended preset.


MOD COMPATIBILITY:

    - Your mod list will determine mod load order. If you have multiple mods in your list that attempt to change the same thing, the
      mod that is lower in your mod list will take priority.

    - For example, if your mod list looks like this:

        // other mods...
        Unleveled Loot
        Meaner Monsters
        Physical Combat & Armor Overhaul
        Bossfall


    - In the above list, Bossfall takes priority. All other mods that try to change what Bossfall changes will be ignored.

    - Or if your mod list looks like this:

        // other mods...
        Unleveled Loot
        Meaner Monsters
        Bossfall
        Physical Combat & Armor Overhaul


    - In the above list, you'll play using Bossfall rules for everything but combat formulas, and you'll play using PCAO's combat
      rules. If you want to use PCAO, I recommend using the mod orders in this list.

    - I recommend placing Bossfall last in your mod list. You're welcome to do otherwise, but depending on the mod below Bossfall
      the game may be very imbalanced or behave strangely. If you run into any errors, please contact me.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES:

    - Bossfall changes nearly every aspect of DFU gameplay (except for Questing). These are the important things you should know.


    BOSSES:

        - Boss enemies are rare. They are extremely dangerous and some have unique abilities.

        - Orc Warlords, Vampires, Ancient Vampires, Daedra Lords, Liches, Ancient Liches, Assassins, and a rare type of
          Dragonling are bosses.

        - Vampires are the easiest bosses. Ancient Liches are the toughest.

        - Boss Dragonlings, Assassins, Vampires, and Ancient Vampires move incredibly fast.

        - Assassin bosses always wield a poisoned weapon, and this poison will pierce your Poison Immunity.

        - Enable the "Boss Proximity Warning" setting to be shown a HUD message whenever a boss is nearby. You won't be shown a
          warning message for stealthy Assassins.

        - The "Powerful Enemies Are" setting determines how often bosses and other tough enemies spawn.


    CHARACTER CREATION:

        - Custom classes by default gain 20 HP/level.

        - Most special advantage/disadvantage costs have changed.

        - Spell Absorption special advantage is too expensive to use (I plan on reworking this advantage at a later date).

        - Most canned classes start with 20 HP/level and 45 HP, canned Barbarian HP/level and starting HP is unchanged.


    COMBAT:

        - Hand-to-Hand accuracy is buffed by equipped Gauntlet/Boot material. This scales like vanilla weapon material bonuses.

        - Some monsters have custom immunities or weaknesses. HUD messages will tell you what works.

        - All enemies have new combat AI. For example, Archers and Rangers will never advance into melee range.


    ENEMIES:

        - Most enemies are tougher, faster, hit harder, and are harder to hit.

        - Each dungeon type and outdoor environment has a unique list of enemies you can encounter. These lists were written
          using common sense. For example, you will find a lot of Giant Scorpions in Desert environments, and you'll find mostly
          Orcs in Orc Stronghold dungeons.

        - Tough, high level monsters are relatively rare.

        - Enemy variety and enemy spell variety greatly increased.

        - The "Enemy Move Speed" setting determines how fast enemies move.

        - Enable the "Display Enemy Level" setting and activate enemies to be shown their level. By default this is left click.


    LEVEL SCALING:

        - Monsters, loot, and human enemies unleveled.

        - Enemy difficulty and loot quality scales with their level. Bosses have greatly increased chances to drop good loot.

        - Once you are Level 7 or higher human enemies are unleveled, and Assassins will have boss stats and damage. Assassin
          poison will pierce your Poison Immunity.

        - If you are Level 6 or lower, all human enemies will be within 2 levels of you, and Assassins won't have boss stats
          or damage. Assassin poison will not pierce your Poison Immunity.


    ITEMS:

        - Daedric and other valuable materials are rare but can appear anytime, anywhere. Your level and Luck do not change material
          generation chances.

        - All weapon/armor durabilities have been decreased. Durability scales down as material tier increases.

        - Shield armor values increase as material tier increases.

        - Most item weights and some item values have changed.

        - Enable the "Alternate Loot Piles" setting to use an expanded vanilla sprite list for variety in loot pile appearance.


    MAGIC ITEMS:

        - All magic items are custom. They have different names, enchantments, and/or uses.

        - Certain Holy items have unique enchantments.

        - You can find a new Dispel Magic potion and potion recipe.


    SHOPS:

        - Store quality determines what items are available. Best-in-slot weapons and armor are not in low quality shops.


    SKILLS:

        - By default, most skills are very difficult to level. Language skills are much easier to level.

        - The "Skill Advancement Difficulty" setting determines how fast you gain skill levels.


    VAMPIRISM:

        - If you are a Vampire, you will be healed varying amounts when you kill anything with fresh blood.


PROJECT HISTORY:

    Bossfall's origin can be traced back to early 2021, when I was on a mission to beat every single game that I currently owned.
    This goal was at first a tedious process, as all the games that were lying around my hard drive were the ones I was avoiding.
    As I had purchased a copy of the original DOOM from GOG.com, I was gifted a little game called TES Chapter I: Arena...

    My first experience with an Elder Scrolls game was not positive. I slogged my way through Arena's opening dungeon, traveled
    to a random city, and wandered around purposeless for some time. I had no idea where to go and what to do. I wandered around
    outside the city's walls and stumbled across a tiny dungeon, which contained nothing interesting. I quit in disgust.

    After trying (and failing) to enjoy Outlast 2, I returned, grudgingly, to Arena. This time, I looked up information on where
    to go to progress the main quest. I had some success with my Battlemage character and found I was enjoying myself a bit, which
    was more than I expected. I explored the first few main quest dungeons thoroughly and began assembling the Staff of Chaos.

    Unfortunately, I soon found out my character was ridiculously overpowered. I crafted some extremely powerful spells and blasted
    my way through the rest of the game, which was a breeze. I couldn't stop looking forwards to trying Daggerfall, though. I
    assumed it was better than Arena, which I thought had lots of potential but ultimately didn't deliver.

    I first fired up GOG.com's version of Daggerfall in mid-2021 and I instantly fell in love. From the moody dungeon music to the
    intricately complicated dungeon designs, I loved it all. I spent hours upon hours in the Iliac Bay. However, I coudn't avoid
    the feeling I was missing something. I did a lot of reading on UESP and found out that Daggerfall was riddled with bugs, which
    bothered me to no end. I wanted my Dodging skill to actually help! Eventually, I found my way to DaggerfallUnity.

    After beating the main quest in vanilla DFU without any mods, I began another playthrough using all the cool mods I wanted. As
    I played, I found myself thinking "what would I change if I could?" I began writing detailed lists of mod ideas that I was unable
    to do anything with, as I had no idea how to implement them. I gradually did more research on what I needed to being modding,
    but it was a frustratingly slow learning process.

    After reading through the codebase trying to decipher the mysteries of C#, I finally started changing vanilla's code in
    mid-October 2021. At that time I had no background or prior experience in programming or coding, so my initial work was
    limited to changing vanilla's formula variables. After about a month of steady work, I released Bossfall v1.1 on the
    DFWorkshop forums in mid-November 2021. It wasn't a .dfmod and was not user-friendly, so it wasn't exactly a hit. 
    
    The non-event of Bossfall's initial release helped me come to a healthy conclusion. Since this was my first programming project,
    I shouldn't expect to be immediately successful. As with anything worth doing in life, success takes lots of time, and lots of
    hard work. Bolstered by that knowledge I began work on v1.2, while also learning the basics of programming in C#. I should've
    learned those fundamentals 'before' trying to write code, but with the helpful comments in vanilla's codebase and lots of
    studying I slowly expanded my programming knowledge. I also discovered, to my dismay, that many of the "improvements" I made in
    v1.1 didn't work, and in the worst cases completely broke the game. Once I got the errors resolved and lots more changes
    finalized, I released v1.2 on the DFWorkshop forums in mid-December 2021.

    Shortly afterwards, DFU 0.13.4 was released. With the lighting changes done, I felt it was time to release Bossfall on NexusMods.
    I uploaded v1.2.1 on Christmas Day, but I ran into yet another problem. Because I was distributing a build of the whole game,
    NexusMods flagged the .exe files in the mod package as suspicious and quarantined Bossfall. What a headache that was! Once
    NexusMods staff got back on the following Monday, I got them to release Bossfall from quarantine.

    Completely unsurprisingly, Bossfall was not very popular on NexusMods, either. While at that point I had dramatically improved
    the quality of my documentation, I couldn't escape the fact that my distribution package was complicated, difficult to deal
    with and to upgrade, and often didn't play nicely with other mods.

    Regardless of this fact I soon resumed work on v1.3, which I released in mid-January 2022. By this point, my Bossfall project
    had grown to an enormous scope, altering nearly one hundred vanilla files and over ten thousand lines of code. My programming
    knowledge had likewise increased. I had also discovered something unexpected - as I learned how to code, I realized that I
    had found my passion in life. I wanted to be a game developer! 

    Due to this realization, I changed how I mentally approached the Bossfall project. Now viewing it as a learning and discovery
    process, I figured it was time to bite the bullet and begin work on a .dfmod. After weeks of more frustration trying to learn
    an entirely new programming system, I began to make significant progress. And finally, I released the Bossfall .dfmod.

    You've read my story, now it's time to make your own. The bosses are waiting for you...


v1.3.1 CHANGELOG:

    Documents every change I made. If no entry on a subject exists, its behavior or values are still vanilla's.

        - Going below default HP/lvl of 20 drops difficulty dagger twice as much as vanilla per point.

        - Rebalanced special advantage/disadvantage costs, this rebalance is slightly different than v1.3's values.

        - Compared to vanilla most advantages are cheaper, most disadvantages drop difficulty dagger much more.

        - All canned classes except for Barbarians start with 45 HP and gain 20 HP/lvl, Barbarian starting HP and HP/lvl unchanged.

        - Full special advantage/disadvantage cost table can be found in the FORMULAS section of the ReadMe.

    COMBAT:

        - Glove/boot material affects player's Hand-to-Hand to-hit roll, scales just like vanilla weapon materials.

        - Glove material affects player's punch to-hit, boot material affects player's kick to-hit.

        - Leather/Chain/Steel/Silver do not alter Hand-to-Hand to-hit rolls.

        - Successful Hand-to-Hand attacks damage player's glove/boot durability based on if attack is punch/kick.

        - Silver gloves/boots will damage Ghosts/Wraiths/Lycanthropes/etc. if player is using Hand-to-Hand.

        - If you're wearing silver gloves you must use punch attacks to damage Ghosts/Wraiths/etc.

        - If you're wearing silver boots you must use kick attacks to damage Ghosts/Wraiths/etc.

        - Exact Hand-to-Hand material formula can be found in the FORMULAS section of the ReadMe.

    GAMEPLAY:

        - Building identification range in "Info" mode doubled.


    HUMAN ENEMIES:

        - If player is level 1-6, all human enemies are within 2 levels of the player and Assassins are not bosses.

        - Human enemies are unleveled (this includes Guards. HALT!) and Assassins become bosses once player hits Level 7.

        - Once player is level 7, human enemies will usually be around level 10. Level 1 and 20 humans are very rare.

        - Human weapon damage scales with their level. Low level humans deal slightly more than weapon damage up to an average
          of 45-50 damage per hit at enemy level 20.

        - When enemies are level 1-15, their material drop chances are static and good materials are quite rare. Material drop
          chances begin scaling with their level at enemy level 16 and higher.

        - Human enemies have 4 armor at Level 1, which is slightly better than Imp armor. They scale up to -4 armor at Level
          20, which is slightly worse than Daedra Seducer armor. Their armor does not change based on their equipment.

        - Human spellcaster spell variety greatly increased, all human spellcasters use the same spells regardless of level.

        - Spellcaster Magicka scales with their level. They will cast 2 spells at level 1, this scales up to 8 at level 20.

        - If using Enhanced Combat AI, Archers and Rangers never voluntarily move into melee range and will always retreat when
          approached. They'd rather shoot arrows.

        - If using Enhanced Combat AI, Barbarians will always charge the player. They're not too bright.

        - Sorcerers, Barbarians, and Rangers are now pacified by the Streetwise language skill.

        - The exact formulas referenced in this section can be found in the FORMULAS section of the ReadMe.


    LOOT GENERATION:

        - All non-enemy loot has been unleveled. This applies to shop shelves, house containers and dungeon and building loot
          piles. The best materials are very rare but possible at any level. Player's level and Luck don't change these drop chances.

        - If a level 1-15 enemy drops loot, it is normal unleveled loot (such as from loot piles, shop shelves, etc.).

        - If a level 16+ enemy drops loot, loot quality scales heavily with enemy's level. Level 30 enemies have extremely high
          chances to drop Daedric items. These drop chances are not changed by player's level or Luck.

        - All gold generation unleveled, gold is much rarer. Player's level and Luck don't change gold generation chances.

        - Ingredient generation unleveled, ingredients are much rarer. Player's level and Luck don't change ingredient chances.

        - Reduced each armor piece's generation chance by approx. 38% for enemies that spawn with equipped armor.

        - Most enemies now have a greatly increased chance to drop Gauntlets.

        - The exact formulas referenced in this section can be found in the FORMULAS section of the ReadMe.


    LYCANTHROPY:

        - If player is in wereform equipped gloves/boots aren't damaged when player attacks and they don't give to-hit bonuses.

        - If player is in wereform they can damage enemies that are normally immune to Hand-to-Hand.


    MAGIC ITEMS:

        - All non-quest-reward magic items are custom and have different names, enchantments, and/or uses.

        - Holy Water, Holy Daggers, and Holy Tomes cast Dispel Undead/Undead/Daedra on use, have 1/3/3 charges.

        - Empty Soul Gems cost 50,000 gold.

        - All non-boss filled Soul Gem costs increased by 50,000 gold.

        - All boss Soul Gem costs and Enchantment Point values greatly increased (except for Assassins, you can't bind human souls).

        - Daedroth Soul Gem cost and Enchantment Point value increased (this is in addition to the previously mentioned 50,000).

        - The new Holy items appear in high quality Pawn Shops and as random loot from enemies, loot piles and house containers.

        - The new Holy items won't dispel Undead/Daedra 100% of the time, success rate depends on player level.

        - Regular magic items found as loot or in stores will never be Holy Water, Holy Daggers, or Holy Tomes.

        - Activating quest enemies in Info mode displays their level and name at any distance.


    SETTINGS:

        - I suggest using the Recommended preset.

        - Settings default to Bossfall v1.2.1 values so current Bossfall players don't have to change settings unless they want to.


        POWERFUL ENEMIES ARE:

            - Determines how often powerful enemies spawn, also tweaks other enemy rarities.

            - "More Common" is Bossfall v1.2.1 spawn frequency, "Less Common" is rebalance I did for v1.3.


        ENEMY MOVE SPEED:

            - Switch between vanilla enemy movespeed and two faster options.

            - "Very Fast" is Bossfall v1.2.1 speeds, "Fast" is rebalance I did for v1.3.


        SKILL ADVANCEMENT DIFFICULTY:

            - Switch between vanilla skill advancement difficulty and two harder options.

            - "Hard" is rebalance I did for Bossfall v1.3, "Extremely Hard" is v1.2.1 difficulty, in my opinion suitable for only
              the most patient adventurers.


        BOSS PROXIMITY WARNING:

            - HUD warning message when (non-Assassin) boss nearby, detection radius half a dungeon block.


        DISPLAY ENEMY LEVEL:

            - Activating an enemy in Info/Talk/Grab mode displays enemy's level as well as name.


        ALTERNATE LOOT PILES:

            - Uses expanded vanilla sprite list so loot piles have some visual variety.

            - May not work perfectly with Handpainted Models.


    SHOPS:

        - Reduced overall item generation chances in shops, shop quality now has huge impact on what's available.

        - Fancy clothing and other expensive-looking items are only in high quality shops.

        - Cuirasses, gauntlets, tower shields, and best-in-slot weapons are not in low quality shops.

        - Shops of average quality or better that are not libraries or bookstores will stock far fewer books.

        - Shops below average quality (sturdy shelves, rusty relics) that are not libraries or bookstores will never stock books.

        - Booksellers stock lots more books.

        - Exact material generation numbers and other shop formulas are in the FORMULAS or ITEM TABLES section of the ReadMe.


    VAMPIRISM:


FORMULAS:

    BOSS SPAWN CHANCES:

        - If the "Powerful Enemies Are" setting is "More Common":

            - Each spawned enemy has a 1/100 chance (1%) to be a boss.


        - If the "Powerful Enemies Are" setting is "Less Common":

            - Each spawned enemy has a 1/140 chance (0.71%) to be a boss.


        - These numbers can be higher if the environment or dungeon type has more than one boss. However, this is very rare. 

        - Now, let's put these numbers into practice. In a large 4-block dungeon, let's say there will be 100 enemies spawned.

            - If the "Powerful Enemies Are" setting is "More Common":

                - There is a 99/100 chance of one enemy to NOT be a boss.

                - For multiple enemies, the chance of them to all NOT be bosses is (99/100)^(number of enemies). ^ means
                  "to the power of".

                - So in this case, calculate (99/100)^(100), which is 0.366, or 36.6%. Remember, this is the chance for all
                  100 enemies to NOT be bosses.

                - Thus, there is a (100% - 36.6%) = 63.40% chance for you to encounter at least one boss in this large 4-block
                  100-enemy dungeon. This calculation does not specify how many bosses you will likely find - it only tells
                  you how likely it is to find at least 1.

                - To calculate the chances of finding at least one boss among a varying number of enemies, use this formula:

                    100 - ((99/100)^(number of enemies) * 100) = your chance of encountering at least 1 boss


            - If the "Powerful Enemies Are" setting is "Less Common":
                    
                - To calculate the chances of finding at least one boss among a varying number of enemies, use this formula:

                    100 - ((139/140)^(number of enemies) * 100) = your chance of encountering at least 1 boss

                - So, for this imaginary 100-enemy dungeon, the chance of encountering at least 1 boss is:

                    100 - ((139/140)^(100) * 100) = 51.2%

    HUMAN ENEMY DAMAGE:

        - Add here if you decide to actually add this - values will be very imprecise early on as enemies will use weapons.
          Is this even going to be helpful? Maybe add average damages every 5 enemy levels or so? That seems more reasonable


    HUMAN ENEMY LEVELS:

        - Add Guard random level boost formula here

        - Add player level 1-6 human enemy level formula here

            60% Levels 9-12

    SKILL ADVANCEMENT DIFFICULTY:

        - Add ur tables here, simply calculate how much more difficult both ur settings are than vanilla as vanilla's exact
          skill calculations are very obtuse and hard to follow IMO


    SPELLS:

        - Add all three current spell kits here


    SPIDER/GIANT SCORPION POISON CHANCES:
