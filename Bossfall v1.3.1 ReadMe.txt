SUMMARY OF CHANGES:

    - Bossfall changes nearly every aspect of DFU gameplay. These are the important things you should know.


    BOSSES:

        - All bosses can be damaged by weapons of any material. Silver deals double damage to undead bosses.

        - Boss enemies are rare. They are extremely dangerous and some have unique abilities.

        - Orc Warlords, Vampires, Ancient Vampires, Daedra Lords, Liches, Ancient Liches, Assassins, and a rare type of
          Dragonling are bosses.

        - Vampires are the easiest bosses. Ancient Liches are the toughest.

        - Boss Dragonlings, Assassins, Vampires, and Ancient Vampires move incredibly fast.

        - Assassins become bosses once you hit level 7 - at this point, their poisoned weapon will pierce your Poison Immunity.

        - Enable the "Boss Proximity Warning" setting to be shown a HUD message whenever a boss is nearby. You won't get a
          warning message for stealthy Assassins.

        - The "Powerful Enemies Are" setting determines how often bosses and other tough enemies spawn.


    CHARACTER CREATION:

        - Custom classes by default gain 20 HP/level.

        - Most special advantage/disadvantage costs have changed.

        - Spell Absorption special advantage is too expensive to use (I plan on reworking this advantage at a later date).

        - Most canned classes start with 20 HP/level and 45 HP, canned Barbarian HP/level and starting HP is unchanged.


    COMBAT:

        - Your Hand-to-Hand accuracy is buffed by equipped glove/boot material. This scales like vanilla weapon material bonuses.


    ENEMIES:

        - Most enemies are tougher, faster, hit harder, and are harder to hit.

        - Vanilla's weapon material requirements to damage certain monsters have been removed.

        - Some monsters have new immunities or weaknesses. HUD messages will tell you what works.

        - Each dungeon type and outdoor environment has a unique list of enemies you can encounter. These lists were written
          using common sense. For example, you will find a lot of Giant Scorpions in Desert environments, and you'll find mostly
          Orcs in Orc Stronghold dungeons.

        - All enemies have new combat AI. For example, Archers and Rangers will never advance into melee range.

        - Tough, high level monsters are relatively rare.

        - Enemy variety and enemy spell variety greatly increased.

        - The "Enemy Move Speed" setting determines how fast enemies move.

        - Enable the "Display Enemy Level" setting and activate enemies to be shown their level. By default this is left click.


    LEVEL SCALING:

        - Monsters, loot, and human enemies unleveled.

        - Enemy difficulty and loot quality scales with their level. Bosses have greatly increased chances to drop good loot.

        - Once you are Level 7 or higher human enemies are unleveled.

        - If you are Level 6 or lower, all human enemies will be within 2 levels of you.


    ITEMS:

        - Daedric and other valuable materials are rare but can appear anytime, anywhere. Your level and Luck do not change material
          generation chances.

        - All weapon/armor durabilities have been decreased. Durability scales down as material tier increases.

        - Shield armor values increase as material tier increases.

        - Most item weights and some item values have changed.

        - Enable the "Alternate Loot Piles" setting to use an expanded vanilla sprite list for variety in loot pile appearance.


    MAGIC ITEMS:

        - All magic items are custom. They have different names, enchantments, and/or uses.

        - Certain Holy items have new enchantments.


    SHOPS:

        - Store quality determines what items are available. Best-in-slot weapons and armor are not in low quality shops.


PROJECT HISTORY:

    Bossfall's origin can be traced back to early 2021, when I was on a mission to beat every single game that I currently owned.
    This goal was at first a tedious process, as all the games that were lying around my hard drive were the ones I was avoiding.
    As I had purchased a copy of the original DOOM from GOG.com, I was gifted a little game called TES Chapter I: Arena...

    My first experience with an Elder Scrolls game was not positive. I slogged my way through Arena's opening dungeon, traveled
    to a random city, and wandered around purposeless for some time. I had no idea where to go and what to do. I wandered around
    outside the city's walls and stumbled across a tiny dungeon, which contained nothing interesting. I quit in disgust.

    After trying (and failing) to enjoy Outlast 2, I returned, grudgingly, to Arena. This time, I looked up information on where
    to go to progress the main quest. I had some success with my Battlemage character and found I was enjoying myself a bit, which
    was more than I expected. I explored the first few main quest dungeons thoroughly and began assembling the Staff of Chaos.

    Unfortunately, I soon found out my character was ridiculously overpowered. I crafted some extremely powerful spells and blasted
    my way through the rest of the game, which was a breeze. I couldn't stop looking forwards to trying Daggerfall, though. I
    assumed it was better than Arena, which I thought had lots of potential but ultimately didn't deliver.

    I first fired up GOG.com's version of Daggerfall in mid-2021 and I instantly fell in love. From the moody dungeon music to the
    intricately complicated dungeon designs, I loved it all. I spent hours upon hours in the Iliac Bay. However, I coudn't avoid
    the feeling I was missing something. I did a lot of reading on UESP and found out that Daggerfall was riddled with bugs, which
    bothered me to no end. I wanted my Dodging skill to actually help! Eventually, I found my way to DaggerfallUnity.

    After beating the main quest in vanilla DFU without any mods, I began another playthrough using all the cool mods I wanted. As
    I played, I found myself thinking "what would I change if I could?" I began writing detailed lists of mod ideas that I was unable
    to do anything with, as I had no idea how to implement them. I gradually did more research on what I needed to being modding,
    but it was a frustratingly slow learning process.

    After reading through the codebase trying to decipher the mysteries of C#, I finally started changing vanilla's code in
    mid-October 2021. At that time I had no background or prior experience in programming or coding, so my initial work was
    limited to changing vanilla's formula variables. After about a month of steady work, I released Bossfall v1.1 on the
    DFWorkshop forums in mid-November 2021. It wasn't a .dfmod and was not user-friendly, so it wasn't exactly a hit. 
    
    The non-event of Bossfall's initial release helped me come to a healthy conclusion. Since this was my first programming project,
    I shouldn't expect to be immediately successful. As with anything worth doing in life, success takes lots of time, and lots of
    hard work. Bolstered by that knowledge I began work on v1.2, while also learning the basics of programming in C#. I should've
    learned those fundamentals 'before' trying to write code, but with the helpful comments in vanilla's codebase and lots of
    studying I slowly expanded my programming knowledge. I also discovered, to my dismay, that many of the "improvements" I made in
    v1.1 didn't work, and in the worst cases completely broke the game. Once I got the errors resolved and lots more changes
    finalized, I released v1.2 on the DFWorkshop forums in mid-December 2021.

    Shortly afterwards, DFU 0.13.4 was released. With the lighting changes done, I felt it was time to release Bossfall on NexusMods.
    I uploaded v1.2.1 on Christmas Day, but I ran into yet another problem. Because I was distributing a build of the whole game,
    NexusMods flagged the .exe files in the mod package as suspicious and quarantined Bossfall. What a headache that was! Once
    NexusMods staff got back on the following Monday, I got them to release Bossfall from quarantine.

    Completely unsurprisingly, Bossfall was not very popular on NexusMods, either. While at that point I had dramatically improved
    the quality of my documentation, I couldn't escape the fact that my distribution package was complicated, difficult to deal
    with and to upgrade, and often didn't play nicely with other mods.

    Regardless of this fact I soon resumed work on v1.3, which I released in mid-January 2022. By this point, my Bossfall project
    had grown to an enormous scope, altering nearly one hundred vanilla files and over ten thousand lines of code. My programming
    knowledge had likewise increased. I had also discovered something unexpected - as I learned how to code, I realized that I
    had found my passion in life. I wanted to be a game developer! 

    Due to this realization, I changed how I mentally approached the Bossfall project. Now viewing it as a learning and discovery
    process, I figured it was time to bite the bullet and begin work on a .dfmod. After weeks of more frustration trying to learn
    an entirely new programming system, I began to make significant progress. And finally, I released the Bossfall .dfmod.

    You've read my story, now it's time to make your own. Tamriel is waiting...

    CHARACTER CREATION:

        - All custom classes start with default HP/lvl of 20, default skill advancement difficulty unchanged.

        - Going below default HP/lvl of 20 drops difficulty dagger twice as much as vanilla per point.

        - Rebalanced special advantage/disadvantage costs, this rebalance is slightly different than v1.3's values.

        - Compared to vanilla most advantages are cheaper, most disadvantages drop difficulty dagger much more.

        - All canned classes except for Barbarians start with 45 HP and gain 20 HP/lvl, Barbarian starting HP and HP/lvl unchanged.

        - Full special advantage/disadvantage cost table can be found in the FORMULAS & TABLES section of the ReadMe.


    COMBAT:

        - All landed attacks damage armor or shield of target struck. In vanilla only weapon attacks damaged armor/shields.

        - All Steel weapons have a minimum damage of 1.

        - Knockbacks heavily nerfed to reduce stunlocks.

        - Strength weapon damage bonus halved.

        - Body parts hit with equal likelihood. In vanilla this was weighted towards chest strikes.


    CRIME & PUNISHMENT:

        - Hostile guards use Knight animations, move faster, shoot arrows, and hit much harder. HALT!

        - If player is level 1-6, Guards will be up to 2 levels below or 12 levels above player. HALT! 

        - Once player is at least level 7, Guards are on average around level 15. Their level range is 1-30. HALT!

        - See FORMULAS & TABLES section of the ReadMe for exact Guard level scaling formulas.

        - Guards carry weapons and armor of any material. HALT!


    ENEMY COMBAT:

        - Vanilla weapon material requirements to damage certain monsters removed. Any material will now damage most enemies.

        - Some monsters have new weapon/material immunities, resistances, and/or weaknesses. HUD messages will tell you what works.
          See MONSTER STATS section for detailed information.

        - All enemies have new combat AI. Some AI changes only apply if you are using Enhanced Combat AI.

        - Enemies fire bows and spells much more often. They also fire them at closer range and from greater distances.

        - Enemies back up and turn much faster. They will retreat and strafe less frequently.

        - When not in melee range, enemies strafe much faster. When in melee range, enemies strafe slowly.

        - Enemy accuracy scales heavily with their level. Their accuracy scales up much faster than vanilla. The toughest enemies
          are nearly twice as accurate as vanilla. See FORMULAS & TABLES section of the ReadMe for detailed accuracy formulas.

        - Enemy attack speed unleveled. In vanilla enemies attacked faster at higher player levels, but in Bossfall enemy attack
          speed is always equal to vanilla's enemy attack speed at player level 10, with greater random variation. See
          FORMULAS & TABLES section of the ReadMe for attack speed formula.

        - Enemy move speed is not reduced while enemy is melee attacking.

        - Enemy STR attribute bonus added to their Hand-to-Hand attack damage, scale is identical to that of player's.

        - Most non-boss enemies have a minimum damage of 1. This is not the case for enemies with Bonus to Hit: Humanoids or for
          human class enemies using Hand-To-Hand - they'll start using Hand-to-Hand around enemy level 5 and higher.

        - Enemies use drugs - Aegrotat, Quaesto Vil, Sursum, Indulcet - as weapon poisons, in addition to vanilla's weapon poisons.


    ENEMY SPAWNING:

        - Enemies unleveled - spawn chances and enemies spawned are not influenced by player level.

        - Every enemy spawn is randomly picked from a list of 100 or 140 - the "Powerful Enemies Are" setting determines length.
          Every dungeon type, location type, and climate has a different list. While outside, day and night have different lists.

        - All dungeons have enemy themes. You will find undead in Crypts, Daedra and spellcasters in Covens, and so forth.
          The easiest dungeons are Cemeteries, the toughest are Vampire Haunts.

        - Heat-loving or heat-tolerant enemies are found outside in Desert, Rainforest, Subtropical, and Swamp wilderness.
          Cold-loving or cold-tolerant enemies are found outside in Woodlands, Mountain, and Mountain Woods wilderness.

        - Difficult, high-level enemies are generally rare.

        - Orcs and humans spawn nearly anywhere, but they are usually rarer at night. Orcs and most humans do not spawn in
          Mountain and Mountain Woods wilderness at night or in Desert wilderness during day or night.

        - Rangers and Barbarians are outdoorsy types, they are rarely found in dungeons. They will spawn in Mountain and
          Mountain Woods wilderness at night, where it is too cold for most humans. Rangers can be found in Desert wilderness
          during the day and at night.

        - Werewolves and Wereboars removed from dungeons, they now only appear outside. They are rare.

        - Spawn frequency has been slightly reduced across all dungeons, locations, climates, and times.

        - Dungeon and outdoor locations use the same spawn chance. In vanilla spawn chances varied depending on player's location.

        - See FORMULAS & TABLES section of the ReadMe for spawn details about every dungeon, climate, location and time of day.


    ENEMY SPELLS:

        - Ghosts and Vampire Ancients no longer cast spells.

        - Enemy spell variety increased, every spellcaster uses same kit except for Frost & Fire Daedra (their spell kits are
          only slightly changed from vanilla's). Standard enemy spell kits include Sphere of Negation.

        - Full enemy spell kits can be found in the FORMULAS & TABLES section of the ReadMe.

        - Spellcaster Magicka scales with their level. They will cast 2 spells at level 1, this scales up to 8 at level 20.

        - The exact Magicka/level scale can be found in the FORMULAS & TABLES section of the ReadMe.

        - Enemies cast Caster Only spells at range. They cast Shalidor's Mirror, Spell Resistance, and Heal.

        - Enemies cast any type of spell within appropriate ranges. In vanilla enemies wouldn't cast certain types of spells
          depending on the Enhanced Combat AI setting in use.

        - I didn't add Hand of Decay as enemies spam you with it in melee range.


    GAMEPLAY:

        - Climbing nerfed, success depends almost entirely on your skill level. Luck now influences your Climbing check success.

        - With 50 Luck you get no Climbing skill check bonus, with 1 Luck you get a 5% penalty, with 100 Luck you get a 5% bonus.

        - Building identification range in "Info" mode doubled.


    HAND-TO-HAND:

        - Glove/boot material affects player's Hand-to-Hand to-hit roll, scales just like vanilla weapon materials.

        - Glove material affects player's punch to-hit, boot material affects player's kick to-hit.

        - Leather/Chain/Steel/Silver do not alter Hand-to-Hand to-hit rolls.

        - Human enemies are unleveled (this includes Guards. HALT!) and Assassins become bosses once player hits Level 7.

        - Once player is level 7, human enemies will usually be around level 10. Level 1 and 20 humans are very rare.

          of 48 damage per hit at enemy level 20.

        - Human enemies have 4 armor at Level 1, which is slightly better than Imp armor. They scale up to -4 armor at Level
          20, which is slightly worse than Daedra Seducer armor. Their armor does not change based on their equipment.

          Warhammer will last exactly as long as a Steel Long Bow or a Steel Wakazashi. A Steel Staff will last exactly as
          long as a Steel Short Bow or Steel Dagger.

        - If a level 16+ enemy drops loot, loot quality scales heavily with enemy's level. Level 30 enemies have extremely high
          chances to drop Daedric items. These drop chances are not changed by player's level or Luck.

          of weapon or shield.

        - All gold generation unleveled, gold is much rarer. Gold dropped by enemies now scales with their level, with significant
          random variation. Player's level and Luck does not change gold generation chances.

        - Ingredient generation unleveled, ingredients are much rarer. All ingredients dropped by enemies now scale with their
          level, with significant random variation. Player's level and Luck does not change ingredient chances.

    POTIONS:

        - Increased potion generation chance by 33% for all enemies that can spawn with them.


    QUESTING:

        - Activating quest enemies in Info mode will display their level and name at greatly increased distances.


    SETTINGS:

        - I suggest using the Recommended preset.

        - Settings default to Bossfall v1.2.1 values so current Bossfall players don't have to change settings unless they want to.


        POWERFUL ENEMIES ARE:

            - Determines how often powerful enemies spawn, also tweaks other enemy rarities.

            - "More Common" is Bossfall v1.2.1 spawn frequency, "Less Common" is rebalance I did for v1.3.


        ENEMY MOVE SPEED:

            - Switch between vanilla enemy movespeed and two faster options.

            - "Very Fast" is Bossfall v1.2.1 speeds, "Fast" is rebalance I did for v1.3.


        BOSS PROXIMITY WARNING:

            - HUD warning message when (non-Assassin) boss nearby, detection radius half a dungeon block.


        DISPLAY ENEMY LEVEL:

            - Activating an enemy in Info/Talk/Grab mode displays enemy's level as well as name.


        ALTERNATE LOOT PILES:

            - Uses expanded vanilla sprite list so loot piles have some visual variety.

            - May not work perfectly with Handpainted Models.


    SHOPS:

        - Reduced overall item generation chances in shops, shop quality now has huge impact on what's available.

        - Fancy clothing and other expensive-looking items are only in high quality shops.

        - Cuirasses, gauntlets, tower shields, and best-in-slot weapons are not in low quality shops.

        - Shops of average quality or better that are not libraries or bookstores will stock far fewer books.

        - Shops below average quality (sturdy shelves, rusty relics) that are not libraries or bookstores will never stock books.

        - Booksellers stock lots more books.

        - Exact material generation numbers and shop formulas are in the FORMULAS & TABLES or ITEM TABLES section of the ReadMe.


    SKILLS:

        - Etiquette and Streetwise are exercised when encountering human enemies even if you don't pacify them. This now matches
          behavior of other language skills.

        - Reduced skill tallies from 3 to 1 for successful language skill pacifications.


FORMULAS & TABLES:

    - This section contains formulas and tables I added or modified. It does not contain any unmodified vanilla formulas or tables.


    BOSS SPAWN CHANCES:

        - If the "Powerful Enemies Are" setting is "More Common":

            - Each spawned enemy has a 1/100 chance (1%) to be a boss.


        - If the "Powerful Enemies Are" setting is "Less Common":

            - Each spawned enemy has a 1/140 chance (0.71%) to be a boss.


        - These numbers can be higher if the environment or dungeon type has more than one boss. However, this is rare. 

        - Now, let's put these numbers into practice. In a large 4-block dungeon, let's say there will be 100 enemies spawned.

            - If the "Powerful Enemies Are" setting is "More Common":

                - There is a 99/100 chance of one enemy to NOT be a boss.

                - For multiple enemies, the chance of them to all NOT be bosses is (99/100)^(number of enemies). ^ means
                  "to the power of".

                - So in this case, calculate (99/100)^(100), which is 0.366, or 36.6%. Remember, this is the chance for all
                  100 enemies to NOT be bosses.

                - Thus, there is a (100% - 36.6%) = 63.40% chance for you to encounter at least one boss in this large 4-block
                  100-enemy dungeon. This calculation does not specify how many bosses you will likely find - it only tells
                  you how likely it is to find at least 1.

                - To calculate the chances of finding at least one boss among a varying number of enemies, use this formula:

                    100 - ((99/100)^(number of enemies) * 100) = your chance of encountering at least 1 boss


            - If the "Powerful Enemies Are" setting is "Less Common":
                    
                - To calculate the chances of finding at least one boss among a varying number of enemies, use this formula:

                    100 - ((139/140)^(number of enemies) * 100) = your chance of encountering at least 1 boss

                - So, for this imaginary 100-enemy dungeon, the chance of encountering at least 1 boss is:

                    100 - ((139/140)^(100) * 100) = 51.2%


    CHARACTER CREATION:

        EQUIPMENT SELECTION:

            - There are three equipment variants. They determine most equipment spawn chances. All enemies that use equipment

    ENEMY SKILL LEVEL SCALING:

        SKILL FORMULA:

            (enemy level * 7) + 30

            - This scales 40% faster than vanilla. It sets weapon, Dodging, Critical Strike, and all other skill levels.


        SKILL CAP:

            180

            - This is 80% higher than vanilla. Bossfall enemies are more accurate and are harder to hit.


    ENEMY SPAWN CHANCES:

        - Every 2.4 game hours several random numbers from 0 to 40 are generated. If any of the random numbers are 0, and if
          enemies are allowed to spawn given current game conditions, a number of enemies equal to the number of randomly generated
          zeroes are spawned from the location or environment's encounter table. This process happens 10 times per game day.
