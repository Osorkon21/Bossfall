Bossfall v1.3.1 Changelog

CHARACTER CREATION:

All custom classes start with default HP/lvl of 20, default skill advancement difficulty unchanged
Going below default HP/lvl of 20 drops difficulty dagger twice as much as vanilla per point
Rebalanced special advantage/disadvantage costs, this rebalance is slightly different than v1.3's values
Compared to vanilla most advantages are cheaper, most disadvantages drop difficulty dagger much more
All canned classes except for Barbarians start with 45 HP and gain 20 HP/lvl, Barbarian starting HP and HP/lvl unchanged

ITEMS:

Arrow weights restored to vanilla values (in previous Bossfall versions arrows weighed something, I found this annoying)

LOOT:

Reduced armor piece generation chances for enemies that spawn with equipped armor

POTIONS:

Slightly increased potion generation chance for all enemies that can spawn with them

QUESTING:

Activating quest enemies in Info mode displays their level and name at any distance

BOSSFALL v1.3.1 TESTING:

Test if ur inventory & trade window (and any other window detections u add) detection in BossfallOnWindowChange detects D.R.E.A.M. (and any other mods that u think might need 2 be checked) versions of these windows (I think it should? Unless it's registering a custom UI window instance... then ur in trouble)
Test built .dfmod w/DFU 0.13.5 make sure ur mod works w/it and doesn't crash
Test ur new shields w/D.R.E.A.M. see if they correctly use modded textures (they should work fine)
Test quest foes in Info mode (make sure "You are too far away" message doesn't pop up & ur custom Level HUD message displays)
Test all enemies for correct move speeds on Vanilla, Fast, and Very Fast settings?
Test "World of Daggerfall" mod w/new .dfmod, save outdoors, load outdoors, save inside, load inside w/Bossfall and World of Daggerfall running @ same time make sure nothing breaks
Test immunity HUD msgs make sure they reset when player kills enemy and don't otherwise
Test house containers make sure they contain ur custom enchanted holy items (that means all ur house container loot generation works)
Make sure enemy spellcasters cast proper number o' spells & u approve
Test vampire/lycan on enemy death stuff make sure u approve
Test dungeon entrance flavor msgs w/a few dungeons make sure u approve
Test skill advancement difficulty on all 3 settings make sure u approve?
Test magic item creation make sure ur items r the ones getting created
Test potion creation make sure Dispel Magic potion (use console 2 create potions) & potion recipe (from Alchemist shops) get created
Test item creation w/enemies that use starting equipment w/out mods make sure it works & u approve
Test item creation w/enemies that use starting equipment w/mods (RPR:I mainly) make sure it works & u approve
Test powerful enemy rarity on both Powerful Enemies Are setting values make sure u approve?
Test startup quest make sure it pops on new game start

BOSSFALL v1.3.1 TO-DO:

.DFMOD ESSENTIALS:

Change falling dmg (follow .DFMOD NOTES section for specific guidance)
Additional wpn swing fatigue cost in BFPlayerActivate Update method (22 extra Fat/swing IIRC, I want it to be the same as vanilla BF, which is 33? Verify all these numbers 2 make sure ofc)
Use ur BossfallMagicItemTemplates 2 create all magic items
40 Spell Cost FormulaOverride for enemies (remember 2 register it w/RegisterOverride)
Add Potion of Dispel Magic
Skill difficulty formula override, use previous skill difficulty tables, vary by Bossfall difficulty setting
Bossfall startup quest
Add BossfallEnemyDeath event handler 4 vampire/lycan on death stuff in BossfallEnemyMotor 2 make it instanced by enemy? Or do it @ end o' FormulaOverride CalculateAttackDamage? See how u did it in v1.3 for guidance
Include StreamingAssets/Quests folder alongside .dfmod file in DL package that contains ur altered vanilla quests, add "put this whole folder in StreamingAssets/Quests if u don't wanna fite Assassins early" note
Include updated v1.3.1 Changelog in DL package

.DFMOD NOTES:

Advise ppl using any mods that change character creation (Better Default Classes, Races Redone, etc.) to put them lower in mod list than BF if they want those mods to take priority over BF character creation changes
Above a certain height (~4 dungeon wall blocks) instakill falling entities, make sure jumping/falling from city walls isn't instakill
Below that falling dmg starts @ 3.8f, dmg is 10f permetrefallen (look @ PlayerHealth for template, use Reflection to implement)
Double check all ur item gen methods that handle loot pile, enemy loot table random items, and shop shelf/house container loot gen - make sure mod items are automatically generated when appropriate so u don't need 2 add them manually (I think this is already the case but it never hurts 2 check)
To implement above line u can get DaggerfallEntityBehaviour from EnemyEntity incoming in parameter of CalculateAttackDamage, then GetComponent<BossfallEnemyMotor>() from DaggerfallEntityBehaviour 2 get access to bools
In BFEnemyMotor in spellcast bools include check 4 enemy's current HP if it's full and enemy wants 2 cast Heal return false
Change Legal Info on NexusMods & 3rd forum post, include blurb about "not all code was written by me, I've marked all code I didn't write, check code for author before using/crediting"
Read thru all scripts, make sure u remove all unnecessary Debug.Log lines and DWI/DELETE WHEN IMPLEMENTED references (after implementing them ofc) b4 releasing anything
In ur enemy loot generation methods, for the (up to) 2 random custom items @ the end, use ItemHelper.GetCustomItemsForGroup(ItemGroups.Weapons) or (ItemGroups.Armor) to find custom wpns/armor & if that method returns something add one or two custom items
Advise users of .dfmod to always put Bossfall last, Meaner Monsters, Unleveled Loot, & RPR:I will conflict w/Bossfall
5189333 is ur Dispel Magic potion key (that uses ur custom Dispel Magic potion recipe)
Create a custom SpellRecords.json file? If this will allow u to easily implement previous Bossfall spell changes, DFU will load it and overwrite vanilla's SpellRecords.txt with ur custom data, remember to include it in Bossfall mod Assets
If u add BossfallEnemyDeath script remember to add this component to custom enemies in BossfallOnLootSpawned method in Bossfall.cs
GameManager.Instance.Dungeon.Summary.DungeonType (or whatever) can be called to see what dungeon type ur entering, use that for ur dungeon entrance flavor msgs, make popup HUD msgs last twice as long as normal? (or SETTING: Make actual msg box popup 2 display ur dungeon entrance flavor txt?)
Add fastMoveSpeeds array to BossfallOverrides populate it w/Bossfall EnemyBasics MoveSpeed field contents
Add skill method override to BossfallOverrides, remember 2 register it w/FormulaOverride, use Bossfall skill difficulty that changes w/Bossfall setting values
Download latest version of all used mods to make sure latest versions work w/Bossfall .dfmod b4 releasing anything
Update all FAQ questions (if necessary) for relevance after .dfmod release on NexusMods and 3rd forum post
Add "why doesn't Disable AI work" FAQ question to NexusMods & 3rd forum post
Add mod interaction settings so Bossfall is always positioned last? If necessary ofc
Write Bossfall .dfmod
After implementing previous version's changes to Bossfall .dfmod add proper section to v1.3.1 Changelog, use old changelog comments if possible, if necessary edit lines for brevity/clarity, delete old line(s), if u can't do it w/current mod support or w/Reflection add IMPOSSIBLE
End goal is clear changelog below v1.3.1 section as it's all been added, but this is a long-term goal not a v1.3.1 goal
Update lines of code & comments added or modified in 2 NexusMods credits spots & 3rd forum post, just put lines o' code & comments in .dfmod
Remove lines of comments from 2 NexusMods credits spots and 3rd forum post
Update time spent in 2 NexusMods credits spots & 3rd forum post, just put "worked on since mid-October 2021", whatever that value in months is

.DFMOD INVISIBILITY:

Credit "thevm" for the inspiration for these Invis changes
Give enemies that used to see thru Invis one-time chance to see thru it (checks once per enemy), have it set bool if check succeeds
Depends on player's Illusion skill, use Lerp to add between 50% chance to see thru Invis @ 1% Illusion skill down to added 0% chance to see thru Invis @ 100% Illusion skill)
Base chance to see thru Invis increases the more powerful the enemy is (Daedra have like 15-20% chance to see thru it)
Add HUD msg to tell player which monster can see thru it & why? ("The Imp is not fooled by your clumsy Illusion spell.")

Base chance to see thru Invis @ 100% player Illusion skill (flesh out rest o' list w/all previous enemies that used 2 see thru Invis):

Imp 0

.DFMOD ITEMS:

Nerf glove/boot H2H durability damage slightly (2 for gloves, 3 for boots), credit "thevm" for feedback that led 2 change

.DFMOD LYCANTHROPY:

Custom HUD messages display when player with Lycanthropy kills innocents (townspeople and Guards), I added 37 different messages
If player with Lycanthropy kills a Guard "Guard just died." message is replaced w/custom HUD message

.DFMOD VAMPIRISM:

Make heal happen only if player kills enemy, include distance check from GitHub Bossfall branch so player only heals in melee range
Figure something out that only fires when player kills an enemy and use that
Edit ur current Vampire msg array, make them generic, not enemy specific
Edit ur current Vampire msg array for tense make any msg fit any enemy name
Add 1 to Zombie/FleshAtronach elements in VampireHealAmount array
Delete current Zombie/FleshAtronach death msgs from Vampire msg array, delete all empty strings from same array as well, delete Harpy msg from same array as well
Display random msg from separate array filled w/gross msgs if VampireHealAmount array element == 1, msgs are "You retch on old %s blood.", "You gag on foul %s blood.", etc.
Display random msg from current Vampire msg array if VampireHealAmount array element > 1, call string.Replace(%s) method, put %s in all msgs 2 indicate where to put enemy name
Add screenshot of Vampire HUD message (an eye-catching msg) to NexusMods, and to forum post somewhere from post 1-3
Add +10 player HP for Vampire civilian NPC kills, pop up standard Vampire on kill HUD msg, put this check in wherever u end up putting Vampire checks

Vampire players are healed when they kill anything with fresh blood, heal amount depends on entity killed
Custom HUD messages are displayed when Vampire player kills an entity, replaces "(enemy) just died." msg, I added 45 different msgs
Custom HUD messages are displayed when entity has old blood (Zombies and Flesh Atronachs), I added 14 different msgs

BOSSFALL v1.4 TO-DO:

ACROBATICS:

Add BossfallClimbingMotor script, add a climbing chance check that runs whenever vanilla's check runs, always run this after vanilla's climbing check, then if player fails ur check set isSlipping (in ClimbingMotor) to true, test if this is all u need to do ofc
In BossfallPlayerActivate Update method? check if IsRappelling is true, if it is save the initial Climbing skill checks value and once IsRappelling is false set Climbing checks to starting value (this makes Rappel mode not give Climbing checks)?

DISEASE/POISON:

Add Poison that inflicts ur custom Slow effect
Add Poison that inflicts ur custom Fear effect
Add Poison that inflicts ur custom Enfeeble effect
Change AssignEnemyStartingEquipment (or equivalent methods for enemies u want to add poison chance for) method to include ur custom poisons 4 wpn poisons
Add more poison/disease curing options? With guilds or something? Or thru temples?

DUNGEON LOOT GENERATION:

This section applies 2 both dungeon loot piles & loot table generated enemy items for enemies in said dungeons, does not apply to enemy equipment
locationModifier = DungeonSize lM * DungeonType lM (Cemetery is just a flat 0.1 lM, not affected by DungeonSize)
Have two parameters implement what this section gets - both are relative to 1, which is starting gen chance of 75 for while loops in BossfallItemBuilder item gen methods & +0 to enemyLevelModifier (which is enemy level * 50, which is fed into ur BossfallOverrides.RandomMaterial method)
A locationModifier of 3 will set starting gen chance of 150 for while loops & +250 to enemyLevelModifier, and a 0.01 locationModifier will set starting gen chance of 0 for while loops & -250 to enemyLevelModifier (a +5 or -5 enemy level boost essentially)

No armor/weapons/ingredients/books underwater, it'd erode, gold & Silver & magic items would not so they can still be there

DungeonSize (pull from playerLocation, dbl check u can read this while ur entering dungeon):

DungeonLabyrinth: 1.5 lM
DungeonKeep: 1 lM
DungeonRuin: 0.5 lM

DungeonType:

Crypt: 0.66 lM
Orc Stronghold: 0.75 lM, Orcish somewhat more common
Human Stronghold: 1 lM
Prison: 1 lM, enemies have higher chance of poisoned weapons
Desecrated Temple: 1.5 lM, tons o' Religious Items
Mine: 0.5 lM Dwarven more common, lots o' Warhammers
Natural Cave: 0.25 lM, armor/wpns very rare, ingredients abound
Coven: 1.75 lM, Books/ingredients/magic items very common in Covens, Daedric somewhat more common
Vampire Haunt: 2 lM, Best loot in the game
Laboratory: 1 lM, Ingredients/magic items very common
Harpy Nest: 0.25 lM
Ruined Castle: 1 lM
Spider Nest: 0.25 lM, mostly clothing and junk
Giant Stronghold: 1.25 lM
Dragon's Den: 0.6 lM, tons o' gold, wpns/armor, higher chance o' magic items, little of everything else as dragons don't collect other stuff
Barbarian Stronghold: 0.8 lM, higher chance o' Iron/Steel, less chance of every other material, no books
Volcanic Caves: 1.5 lM
Scorpion Nest: 0.4 lM, mostly clothing and junk
Cemetery: 0.1 lM, mostly clothing and junk, this number doesn't change based on DungeonSize, is constant

ENEMY LOOT:

This section determines WHAT KIND of items will be generated for all enemies that drop items, each enemy's item symbol array affects what items drop & their gen chances
Make one item creation method & vary what it outputs depending on incoming enemy item symbol array
Break up this method into 2 parts - one part gens wielded equipment (remember 2 equip everything to enemy in this section, use BFItemBuilder GenerateEnemyEquipment -or whatever - as template 2 follow), one part gens random loot
Rework current item gen methods, remove all traces of old 2-step item gen process and methods from BFEventHandlers from every event handler that generates items (3 event handlers do this, dbl check 2 make sure u catch every item gen method ofc)
Add another layer 2 ur custom enemy item gen method - this (final?) layer determines what armor/wpn templates are available 2 be generated for that enemy for wielded equipment & how rare the BIS wpns/armor are
Use ur current vars locationModifier & enemyLevelModifier (or just enemyLevelModifier 2 be more clear if possible/practical) to determine what item templates can be spawned as wielded equipment & how rare the BIS items are - if mod item replacements for selected item exist add ~40% chance to gen mod item instead of vanilla
For any enemy the BIS wpns/armor should always be able 2 be generated as wielded equipment if enemy uses that type of equipment (for example Thieves never wield 2H wpns so never give 'em 2H as wielded equipment)
If enemy doesn't wield a particular equipment type enemy can carry it as random loot, ur above modifiers determine how likely this is
For class enemies - they never wield armor materials they can't use, but they can carry them as random loot
For class enemies - they preferably wield best armor material 4 their class (Chain for Barbs, Plate for Warriors, etc.) but they can have worse material tiers equipped ofc
Scale ingredient gen chances using the same enemyLevelModifier u end up using for ur new random enemy level-scaled gold gen formula (once u come up w/new gold gen formula ofc)
Make enemy items spawn damaged? They can be very beat-up, or in perfect shape - weight chances to be around 50% to 65% durability? This number is prelim & can change
Go thru all current BF loot spawn methods make sure to convert everything 2 work w/ur new one-size-fits-all item gen method, delete all traces of old code that won't work anymore or aren't used

Non-magical or non-spellcasting enemies: -IC, +IQ, -PO, -POQ, xPOR, xPORQ
Spellcasters: +IC, +IQ, +BK, +PO, POQ, +POR, PORQ
Thief: +GJC, +GJQ, +G, MC? +MC?
Burglar: GJC, +GJQ, +G, PC? -PC?
Bards +PC, -MC? MC?
Acrobats: +CC, +CQ
All class enemies drop clothing, quality depends on enemy
Make item rarity in ItemTemplates some kind o' key that determines what enemies carry them & how rare they are? Do this at least for wpns/armor?

When finished building item chance/quality list at end of this section, to add this as code, convert + to 3, normal to 2, - to 1, x to 0, add finished array 2 code in BossfallItemBuilder up top as field as follows:

static Dictionary<byte, byte[]> enemyItemGenData = new Dictionary<byte, byte[]>();

where byte = MobileEnemy.ID and byte[] is the enemy item chance/quality list converted to an array

In Bossfall.Init initialize the dictionary w/values in it already, store dictionary in BFItemBuilder
Re-order below list once entries are complete 2 match ascending order of enemy IDs(dbl check 4 accuracy ofc)
Don't copy/paste entire item array collection 2 BFItemBuilder once complete - copy/paste each enemy's item array one @ a time (name included) so u can dbl check the enemy item array ends up in the right order
When u convert item symbol arrays w/Find/Replace 2 ints, convert special symbols (e.g. +G, -G, xG) first, then as last step convert regular symbols to int (e.g. G), dbl check 4 accuracy as u go ofc

Implement item generation changes from section below this one as follows:

Higher gold amount doubles gold generated in BossfallItemBuilder
Lower gold amount quarters? halves? gold generated in BossfallItemBuilder

For higher bow/weapon/armor/magic item quality indicators:

Higher (item) quality raises enemyLevelModifier by 250 for that item group
Lower (item) quality reduces enemyLevelModifier by 250 for that item group

For 2H, 1H, 1HS, 21H, BC:

Higher chance means const 75% chance enemy will use this wpn kit (this const is split equally among all higher indicators if multiple are present), 25% something else (if nothing else is possible, then Higher chance = 100% chance obv)
Normal chance total probability must equal twice that of total lower probability if both are present and complications arise
Lower chance means 1/4 total chance of higher's total chance of occurring, 1/2 total chance of normal's total chance of occurring (see below line for more specific situational guidance)
Highest indicator always has priority and will get full probability of occurring, no matter what (e.g. if there's 1 higher, 2 normal, and 1 lower indicator, the higher has full 75% chance of occurring, 2 normal must equal a total probability twice that of lower's, so each normal has 8.33% chance of happening, so lower ends up w/8.33% chance of happening)
If there are multiple wpn kits w/same higher/lower indicator, split up probability evenly between them (e.g. if there are 2 higher indicators and 2 lower, then higher indicators each have 37.5% chance, lower indicators each have 12.5% chance of happening)
If there is one higher/normal indicator and multiple lower indicators, split up probability evenly between the lower indicators, higher/normal remains 75%/50% chance of happening

While loop generated items:

Make this clothing generation while loop NOT generate any kind of cloak (they're generated elsewhere)  |
                                                                                                       v
Higher armor/ingredient/book/religious item/clothing chance raises starting while loop chance in BossfallItemBuilder by 50 for that item group
Lower armor/ingredient/book/religious item/clothing chance reduces starting while loop chance in BossfallItemBuilder by 50 for that item group

Higher ingredient quality generates using all ingredients (if that differentiation has already been made in vanilla code, if not make a custom list)
Normal ingredient quality generates using mid-tier ingredient list & lower (if that differentiation has already been made in vanilla code, if not make a custom list)
Lower ingredient quality generates using low-tier ingredient list only (if that differentiation has already been made in vanilla code, if not make a custom list)

Higher magic item chance raises starting while loop chance in BossfallItemBuilder by 3 for magic item group (or whatever number is necessary to not always be 0 or less if Lower indicator is raised)
Lower magic item chance reduces starting while loop chance in BossfallItemBuilder by 3 for magic item group (or whatever number is necessary to not always be 0 or less if Lower indicator is raised)

Higher religious item quality can generate all non-custom religious items and all my custom holy items
Normal religious item quality can generate all non-custom religious items plus custom Holy Water
Lower religious item quality can generate all non-custom holy items minus Holy Candles (they're worth too much)

Higher clothing quality can generate all clothing
Normal clothing quality can generate clothing with rarities up to 17 (item rarities are set in ItemTemplates.txt)
Lower clothing quality can generate clothing with rarities up to 13 (item rarities are set in ItemTemplates.txt)

Non-while loop items - these are chances to generate only 1 item, they'll never generate more than 1:

Higher map chance raises chance by 3 (or whatever number is necessary to not always be 0 or less if Lower indicator is raised)
Lower map chance reduces chance by 3 (or whatever number is necessary to not always be 0 or less if Lower indicator is raised)

Higher potion chance raises chance by 3
Lower potion chance reduces chance by 3

Higher potion quality unlocks Bossfall OP potion tier
Normal potion quality uses standard vanilla potions
Lower potion quality will be crappy vanilla potions (slowfall, chameleon, shadow form, any other terrible ones I can think of)

Higher potion recipe chance raises chance by 1
Lower potion recipe chance reduces chance by 1

Higher potion recipe quality unlocks Bossfall OP potion recipe tier
Normal potion recipe quality uses standard vanilla potion recipes
Lower potion recipe quality will be crappy vanilla potions (slowfall, chameleon, shadow form, any other terrible ones I can think of)

Higher painting chance is 3
Normal painting chance is 2
Lower painting chance is 1

Split incoming Gem/Jewelry chance into 2 separate generation methods with chance at generating 2 items total - 1 gem, 1 jewelry with following probabilities:

Higher gem chance is 5
Normal gem chance is 3
Lower gem chance is 1

Higher gem quality can generate a gem of any rarity
Normal gem quality can generate gems with rarities up to 17 (item rarities are set in ItemTemplates.txt)
Lower gem quality can generate gems w/rarities up to 13 (item rarities are set in ItemTemplates.txt) - pearls only, I think, if I'm wrong then generate some random nearly worthless tiny chunk of metal from ingredient list

Higher jewelry chance is 15
Normal jewelry chance is 10
Lower jewelry chance is 5

Higher jewelry quality selects from all jewelry
Normal jewelry quality can generate jewelry with rarities up to 17 (item rarities are set in ItemTemplates.txt)
Lower jewelry quality can generate jewelry with rarities up to 13 (item rarities are set in ItemTemplates.txt)

Higher cloak chance is 10
Normal cloak chance is 6
Lower cloak chance is 2

Higher cloak quality is Formal Cloaks, no Casual Cloaks
Normal cloak quality is Formal and Casual Cloaks (50/50 split on generation probability)
Lower cloak quality is Casual Cloaks, no Formal Cloaks

Higher set item chance is 1/5 (VampireAncient, DaedraLord, AncientLich)
Normal set item chance is 1/15 (Assassin bosses, OrcWarlord, Dragonling_Alternate)
Lower set item chance is 1/25 (Vampire, Lich)
Non-boss set item chance is 1/1000

ENEMY EQUIPMENT GENERATION:

For enemies that use equipment (under current Bossfall rules) this section determines QUANTITY and QUALITY of generated equipment based on location/enemy factors

Instead of using current BossfallItemBuilder AssignEnemyStartingEquipment method, if enemy uses equipment give 'em their own unique equipment creation method w/probabilities 4 each item/item type (for example ingredients on a Mage, wpns on a Warrior), make sure 2 not generate full suits of armor too often
Equipment generation is altered based on locationModifier which will change depending on where enemy is, time of day, this will affect both quantity of equipment generated and item material rarity gen chances
For each armor piece check if mod variants are available, if so 60% use vanilla armor piece 40% use a random mod piece, material tier selection chances same for both variants
Only gen armor that class can use if gen for human class enemy (for equipment gen, loot table gen can be anything)
Only gen 1 armor piece per protected body part (for equipment gen, loot table gen can be anything)
For each wpn kit selected to be used (2H, 1H, 1H + SH, 2 1H, BC) check if mod variants 4 that wpn type is available, if so use 60% vanilla wpns and 40% mod variants, only gen one or the other, material tier selection chances same 4 both variants
Have two parameters implement what this section gets - both are relative to 1, which is starting gen chance of 75 for while loops in BossfallItemBuilder item gen methods & +0 to enemyLevelModifier (which is enemy level * 50, which is fed into ur BossfallOverrides.RandomMaterial method)
A locationModifier of 3 will set starting gen chance of 150 for while loops & +250 to enemyLevelModifier, and a 0.01 locationModifier will set starting gen chance of 0 for while loops & -250 to enemyLevelModifier (a +5 or -5 enemy level boost essentially)

ITEM SETS:

Item materials listed are for color only
Currently not using Mace/Flail FPS Weapon sprites, add themed sets that use them? Can't think of any good ones tho
Give set items ~x5 Steel durability
Give set items ~x5 Daedric value
Give set items +30? +40? to-hit bonus (have GetWeaponMaterialModifier in DaggerfallUnityItem return 3? 4?)
Use SetResistanceFlag in DaggerfallEntity to apply set item resistances, make sure flag is lowered when bonus isn't granted anymore
Add low % chance of calling GenerateSetItem function in Bossfall custom item generation methods when any items are generated
Have set items pop up 2nd msg box after item info
In 2nd msg box for set items show grey/black text list w/current set, turn equipped set items white, search equipped items for set items when player clicks on a set item in "Info" mode in the inventory
In 2nd msg box for set items below list of equipped/total set items put grey/black list w/bonuses granted w/multiple set items equipped, turn bonuses white if player is currently granted these bonuses
Make sure u update set effects w/every item equip/unequip
2 set items +1 bonus, 3 set items +2 bonuses, 5 set items all bonuses, put bonuses in worst-to-best order, make sure list lights up from top to bottom as player equips more of the current set, follow this list pattern for every set
Add +dmg from sets to ModifyAttackDamage FormulaOverride (or whatever) function in FormulaHelper? Or in CalculateAttackDamage FormulaOverride?
Give set items (per set, maybe?) unique property or bool so I can search equipped items for all items in the current set w/that property or bool
Give all set items custom names so player knows they're unique
Add "set" to "add" console command (or just add custom "create setItem" or "add setItem" console command), creates random set item (so u can test set item generation)
For ur set items in DaggerfallUnityEnums see if clothing dyes work on weapons, if so use those for set items w/custom colors (in inventory at least, won't look any different on HUD)
In DaggerfallInventoryWindow u can set background colors for set items in ItemBackgroundColourHandler function
Use DaggerfallEntityBehaviour.Entity.SetIncreasedArmorValueModifier to boost armor from item sets?
create SetItemTemplate.txt file, make it an array exactly like ItemTemplates.txt file but w/ur new fields?
Make set wpns use Magic FPS weapon sprites

LOCATION LOOT GENERATION:

This applies 2 both non-dungeon interior loot piles (in settlements) & all enemy loot table generated items for outdoor enemies in said locations, does not apply to enemy equipment
Make locationModifier in code (wherever it's used to generate this type o' loot) multiply rather than add, this will affect material rarity generation rates and how much loot gets generated
Have two parameters implement what this section gets - both are relative to 1, which is starting gen chance of 75 for while loops in BossfallItemBuilder item gen methods & +0 to enemyLevelModifier (which is enemy level * 50, which is fed into ur BossfallOverrides.RandomMaterial method)
A locationModifier of 3 will set starting gen chance of 150 for while loops & +250 to enemyLevelModifier, and a 0.01 locationModifier will set starting gen chance of 0 for while loops & -250 to enemyLevelModifier (a +5 or -5 enemy level boost essentially)


if (isDay)
locationModifier = LocationTypesDay lM

if (!isDay)
locationModifier = LocationTypesNight lM

Make loot piles completely different from dungeon loot piles (I'm thinking greatly reduce gold/valuables, mostly have household items and clothing)
If player activates a (non-custom) loot pile (see if this is all u need to check), if player fails a Pickpocket check the guards arrive, popup HUD msg box in that case "Hey! That's mine!" or "You hear a shout. You've been spotted!" or "Stop! Thief!"

MISCELLANEOUS:

Credit "thevm" for this fix - armor durability is being dmged even if player fully blocks all incoming dmg w/Shield, make it so if Shield blocks all dmg armor doesn't get dmged (to accomplish this, check 4 shield presence in BossfallOverrides.CalculateAttackDamage, dmg armor if appropriate, use code in DaggerfallEntity.DecreaseHealth as template)
Rework Spell Absorption Special Advantage and from the Item Maker - make it not 100%. Similar to how the spell Spell Absorption works? Or dependent on your WIL? Once rework's done, re-enable Spell Absorption from character creation & from Item Maker
Add avatar to DFWorkshop & NexusMods (the Ancient Lich pose from Bossfall cover picture?)
De-link extended enemy activation distance from DisplayEnemyLevel ON setting? Currently only displays msgs for enemies at longer range than vanilla if that setting is ON, change it if it really matters to you...
Rework Pickpocket using Reflection?
If it's a mod-added enemy, they won't have a moveSpeed set by ur moveSpeed arrays and will break the game. Set up a workaround for this

QUESTING:

Refine quest gold generation to be more reasonable, potentially raise minimum gold range from 10
If possible increase dungeon quest rewards across the board, and check if quest sends u to kill a boss and greatly raise reward in that case

SHOPS:

Shop material tier caps and material rarities based on shop quality level:

Rusty relics: 89%? Iron, 10%? Steel, 1%? Elven (I am making these numbers up, they're subject to change ofc)
Sturdy shelves: Mostly Iron, sometimes Steel, rarely Elven, very rarely Dwarven
Average: Mostly Iron and Steel, sometimes Elven, rarely Dwarven, very rarely Mithril/Adamantium
Better appointed: Mostly Iron/Steel, Elven fairly common, sometimes Dwarven, rarely Mithril/Adamantium, very rarely Ebony
Incense: use standard random 0-1024 + 1 roll from RandomMaterial (in other words make no changes to current Incense shop item rarity)

General stores/pawn shops buy wpns/armor but don't repair them
General stores rarely stock short blades (never better than Steel?) and leather armor (or modded leather armor [never better than Steel?]), that's only wpn/armor types/materials they stock
Pawn shops rarely stock wpns/armor (can be anything, of any material tier [material tier caps from store quality will apply as normal]) but it's always between 10-50% durability (follow below line's precise durability range probabilities)
Pawn shop items are always damaged, on average 30% durability, goes from 10%-50% durability, weight it so 10-17 and 43-50 is very rare, 18-24 and 36-42 is pretty rare, and 25-35 is common
Pawn shops stock way more junk items, they don't stock nearly enough stuff as of now
Armorers/weaponsmiths stock and repair all types of wpns/armor (obviously)

For ur store material tier caps make separate GenerateRandomMaterial method for each store quality tier w/diff probabilities? or add check for store quality to RandomMaterial method and implement store quality difference there?

SPELLS:

Mod template to use for new spells is in EntityEffectBroker in RegisterCustomEffectDemo & RaiseOnRegisterCustomEffectsEvent methods (do u want to use this w/ur new spells? prolly cuz u won't have a classic effect key)

ADD Enfeeble - all target types 'cept caster only, reduces target wpn damage (~33%?)
ADD Fear - all target types 'cept caster only, reduces target armor (~33%?) & target accuracy (~33%?)
ADD Polymorph spell - all target types 'cept caster only, (use Wabbajack or Morph Self effect), enemies can't use it, very expensive, costs and chance of success same as Disintegrate, Alteration school, morphs enemy into random other enemy (feed it thru seteEntityDefaults to set lvl n stuff) w/new loot (to avoid polymorphing Ancient Liches into Rats and getting a bunch of Daedric), what would it do if a monster reflected it??? Hmm... that's a big problem... would it change u into a random monster? Now that would be insane work... doubt it'll be very practical as it might not work and might create an Ancient Lich but it'd be fun for sure
ADD Slow spell - all target types 'cept caster only, reduces movespeed by 33%? or 50%?
ADD Haste spell - player caster only, boosts Running skill (~25?)
ADD to bosses some kind of Summon Nasties spell (1-3 vermin, golems, or undead), make HUD msg pop up so player knows enemies are summoned

REWORK Balyna's Balm - heals 15 HP/cast
REWORK Heal - heals 50 HP per cast/potion
REWORK Stamina - heals 30 Fatigue per cast/potion
REWORK Regeneration - a flat 10? 15? HP/magic round
REWORK Shield spell (make it block 50%? 100%? more incoming damage)
REWORK so Holy Water/Dagger/Tome work 100% of the time rather than by player lvl (u could change how Dispel Undead/Daedra work or add custom spells I suppose)
REWORK low Magicka cost spells so they tally skill less, make high cost spells tally more? Some kind of skillTallyCounter, similar to runningTallyCounter, high MP cost spells raise counter more? Trying to figure out a way to make 5 MP cost spells not so efficient for training...
REWORK Create Item spell to not create stuff player can't use, check player's forbidden material & forbidden armor types to do this, then add very low base chance (0.1% at player spell skill level of 1%?) of higher (Adamantium cap?) tier material generation for wpns or armor, increase high tier material creation chance as player spell skill level increases, also increase material tier cap (up to Ebony?) at player spell skill level of 100%, credit "thevm" for this
REWORK Shield spell - refresh magnitude on re-cast before the spell expires (i.e. refresh Shield strength even if the end of the magic round hasn't happened and removed effects, so once Shield is broken and before it's removed on the new magic round you can re-cast Shield and re-up the magnitude w/out having to wait. If u do this make Shield stackable? Could be cool)

POTIONS:

ADD Haste potion - boosts Running skill by ~25
ADD Regeneration potion (if not already present)
ADD Magicka Regeneration potion (4 Magicka/round for 250? rounds) Expensive
ADD potion of Full Healing (make Heal True do this)
ADD potion of Full Healing for Mana (Restore Power True)
ADD potion of Full Healing for Stamina (Stamina True)
ADD potion of Restoration True (heal EVERYTHING to full, costs 2500? gold)
ADD the really OP potions to bosses only (Restoration True, Long term Magicka Regeneration, OP HP Regen potion are only really really good ones I can think of)

REWORK Dispel Magic potion so it doesn't clear player's Teleport anchor(s) - credit "thevm" for this fix

WILDERNESS LOOT GENERATION:

Only will apply 2 enemy loot table generated items for enemies spawned outdoors in map pixels that don't contain a location (wilderness areas), does not apply to enemy equipment
Loot content/quality scales on difficulty of enemies that can spawn current climate and scales by whether it's day/night
Have two parameters implement what this section gets - both are relative to 1, which is starting gen chance of 75 for while loops in BossfallItemBuilder item gen methods & +0 to enemyLevelModifier (which is enemy level * 50, which is fed into ur BossfallOverrides.RandomMaterial method)
A locationModifier of 3 will set starting gen chance of 150 for while loops & +250 to enemyLevelModifier, and a 0.01 locationModifier will set starting gen chance of 0 for while loops & -250 to enemyLevelModifier (a +5 or -5 enemy level boost essentially)

BOSSFALL v1.5 TO-DO:

Clone HDD onto SSD, put SSD into comp remove HDD
Superwipe HDD, once securely wiped dispose of it (or keep it for a backup?)
Get Discord (join DFU mod channel - Lysandus' Tomb) https://discord.gg/2x97zbGZxj is Discord link
Look up "FullSerializer" (is it a Unity or C# thing?) and the difference between declaring/using/invoking that and the "[Serializable]" thing u see everywhere
Look up "[fsObject()]" and what it does (it's a sub-class? attribute? property? of "FullSerializer" I would think), I think it marks individual "GameObjects" to be "fully serialized", whatever that means and actually does
Give Spriggans 3 "lives", make 'em more powerful w/each life as described in DF Chronicles
If a nymph drains you below 0 fatigue, advance time by 14 days and FillVitalSigns(). Teleport them into a random dungeon, minus all their gold - reasoning is while you were exhausted you couldn't resist her nymphly charms and became her puppet for 2 weeks. She stole all your gold (it's shiny and pretty) and left you alone finally because she got bored. Potentially add quest to hunt her down for revenge - she could leave a note on your body roughly translated as "thanks for all the fun and your shiny gold, signed Aetheria" written in Nymph, you gotta take it to a local Nymph expert at a Mages Guild who will turn beet-red and refuse to translate it word-for-word (it's too scandalous) but will tell you it's a well-known Nymph who hangs out at such and such dungeon, make sure u flag quest X for adult/nudity
Write some Bossfall-specific quests, replace "Quests for Grown-Ups", use any good ideas from the existing plot outlines you wrote
Add some Bossfall-specific dungeons 2 go w/ur Bossfall-specific quests? If ur motivated 2 do so
Add a way to pop up potion maker outside of temple potion mixer service - if u "use" a cauldron or pot or something (you can use RegisterCustomActivation in PlayerActivate for either a model or a flat (a sprite I think) to do custom actions on activation of said model or flat)? Make potion mixing this way require an empty bottle per potion? You may have to add empty bottles to random loot generation?
SETTING: Make dungeons serializable (save their contents), reset yearly on 1st of Morning Star
SETTING: Once u serialize dungeons make quests always send u to a new non-visited dungeon first, once all dungeons in region are visited then quests will send u to already visited dungeons
SETTING: Make visited/non-visited dungeon lists reset yearly on 1st of Morning Star. Dungeons will respawn on that date, maybe syncing visited dungeon list to reset on that date is a good idea?
Nerf shop stealing, make almost all shelf wpns/armor Iron if in shop after open hours - for Alchemists almost always generate from crappy ingredient lists, for Pawn Shops almost never let holy items/gems generate, for clothing shops almost never let Priest/ess Robes, Khajiit Suits & the like generate (like 1% chance of shelf item generation at regular loot odds, so it will be huge nerf to stealing), save the shelf contents for the open/closed block of time (to avoid "loot an entire shelf of crappy Iron stuff, close/reopen it, more items appear, loot it again" exploit loop), no more (so for-sale items effectively reset every 24 hours, like vanilla)
Fix inconsistent class generation questions (for example the Mage template - if you answer "Mercantile" you get bio notes about swimming, if you answer "Swimming" you get bio notes about talking and haggling with merchants?
SETTING:? Implement execution if player is guilty of murder - send 'em to a Prison but remove all their items and gold first (a brutal punishment, so maybe add it as a setting)
Use RemoveItem in a for loop to remove all of player's items when executing player for crime & before sending them to a prison, make sure to unequip all items if equipped, update equipped armor values after each armor item unequipped, and avoid removing quest items
SETTING:? overhaul enemy combat movement/AI, give enemies custom AI for more variety over v1.2's one-size-fits-all AI
SETTING:? create runAway bool in EnemyMotor, true once enemy is below 1/8 HP (only if they don't have Adrenaline Rush & not Undead, if they do they keep fighting 'til they die), put in delay of 0.3-0.8 for non-perfect runAway reflexes, pop up HUD message "The (insert enemy name) turns to run."
SETTING:? If runAway is true outside enemy runs for it (original vector is raycast straight from player's camera facing at time bool turns true, so it should look like they turn tail and bolt, you'll have to put in some building/in location pixel checks so they don't try to run through the side of a building) at movement speed x1.5-2.0, after 5-10 seconds if they pass a check of minimum distance to player they disappear (use DestroyGameObject), if check fails (player is chasing) they keep running until check runs again, repeat until distance check passes or enemy dies
SETTING:? If runAway is true inside somehow get them outside of player camera raycast hit and once they're out of range for 1-2 seconds (and they pass a minimum distance to player check) DestroyGameObject so they disappear
SETTING:? If enemy is magic user once runAway is true (they turn and run as normal) start a random timer from 0.3-~3-5 seconds, if they're still below 1/8 HP (they might cast Heal while running, if so they break out of runAway and keep fighting) play Magic spell cast sound, show sparkles effect, DestroyGameObject so they disappear, pop up HUD message "The (insert enemy name) teleports away."
SETTING:? Once runAway is true send monster on initial vector = player's camera, on updates (or once they hit an obstacle) send out raycasts at 90 degrees to left and right, also send out angled raycasts at ~45 degrees (whatever degree works best for stairs) to their left/right to check for passageways, have 'em run towards an opening at least once they hit an obstacle perhaps sooner, maybe if random.range is 0 out of 0-1 send 'em thru the first opening so it looks like they duck for cover ASAP
SETTING:? Do not ever let quest monsters/enemies use runAway as that would likely break quest, put in quest target check on runAway initialization check
SETTING:? U can use slope check in line ~1276 of EnemyMotor where it does check.Up.y++ to check for upward slopes
SETTING:? Give Thieves/Burglars/Rogues/Acrobats a random chance to take one/two of ur items and some gold, add it to theirs, then they run away (use runAway bool/function)

All other materials deal x1 dmg

Werewolf/Wereboar:
Silver weapons/gloves/boots deal x1 damage
All other materials deal 1/2 dmg

ITEMS:

Shield armor scales with material tier, now shields made of high tier materials are actually useful
An Iron Tower Shield grants 3 armor, an Elven Tower Shield grants 5 armor, a Daedric Tower Shield grants 10 armor
Leather/Chain/Steel/Silver shield armor values unchanged
Enchanted Boots/Gauntlets broken by H2H durability damage disappear from inventory like other broken magic items

MAGIC ITEMS:

Holy Water displays custom HUD message when used

MISCELLANEOUS CODE CHANGES:

If it feels to you like v1.3 features less gameplay changes than previous major versions, I agree - I spent tons of time improving my code efficiency
Player likely won't notice any of the below changes but I mention them due to the time/energy investment
Greatly increased efficiency of Bossfall enemy move speed and AI code
Greatly increased efficiency of Bossfall FormulaHelper code, mostly in attack formulas
Changed saves/loads to save/restore enemy level and all level-dependent values (human enemy damage & armor, spell damage, skill levels)
Backwards compatible w/old Bossfall saves & non-Bossfall saves, this adds an "enemyLevel" line to all enemies in your save file
Improved vanilla mod support by reverting to vanilla DFU code in a few places and moving my changes elsewhere to not conflict w/mods

SETTINGS:

"Bossfall" settings section added to Advanced Settings top bar after Accessibility section
Click the "Use Recommended Settings" button to set everything to the settings I recommend
Settings default to Bossfall v1.2.1 values so current Bossfall players don't have to mess around with settings unless they want to

"Powerful Enemies Are:" (I recommend LESS COMMON) Determines how often powerful enemies spawn, also tweaks other enemy rarities
"More Common" is Bossfall v1.2.1 spawn frequency, "Less Common" is rebalance I did for v1.3

"Enemy Move Speed" (I recommend FAST) Switch between vanilla enemy movespeed and two faster options
"Very Fast" is Bossfall v1.2.1 speed, "Fast" is rebalance I did for v1.3

"Skill Advancement Difficulty" (I recommend HARD) Switch between vanilla skill advancement difficulty and two harder options
"Hard" is rebalance I did for Bossfall v1.3, "Extremely Hard" is v1.2.1 difficulty, IMO suitable for only the most patient adventurers

"Boss Proximity Warning" (I recommend ON) HUD warning message when (non-Assassin) boss nearby, detection radius half a dungeon block

"Display Enemy Level" (I recommend ON) Activating an enemy in Info/Talk/Grab mode displays enemy's level as well as name

"Alternate Loot Piles" (I recommend ON) Uses expanded vanilla sprite list so loot piles have some visual variety
May not work perfectly with graphics mods like D.R.E.A.M. and Handpainted Models

SKILLS:

Player will start climbing much more frequently at low Climbing skill levels

VAMPIRISM:

If player is a Vampire, they heal 2 HP every landed Hand-to-Hand attack


Bossfall v1.2.1 Changelog

CHARACTER CREATION:

BOSSFALL essentially requires a custom super-powered character, so I rebalanced custom character creation
Moved default custom class HP/Level to 20 rather than 8, did not increase default skill advancement difficulty
Most advantages are cheaper, most disadvantages drop difficulty dagger much more
Reducing HP/Level below 20 drops difficulty dagger much more per point

COMBAT MECHANICS:

Restored enemy strafe timer to vanilla functionality (not working right previously due to my error)

DUNGEONS:

Streamlined random selection of enemies, dungeons may load a bit faster
Sabertooth Tigers/Grizzly Bears removed from Mine dungeon types, more Giant Bats and Rats

ITEMS:

I noticed I reduced Weapon generation in General Stores. I forgot to add that to v1.2 Changelog


Bossfall v1.2 Changelog

BANKING:

You can only have one bank loan at a time, different regions will not loan you more
Defaulting on any loan will permanently ban player from getting another loan from any region
Bank loans charge 20% interest rather than 10%

BOSS INFO:

Assassins will switch to having boss stats once player is Level 7 or higher (2 levels higher than v1.1)
Assassin weapon poison bypasses Poison Immunity once player is Level 7 or higher (Immunity bypass didn't work in v1.1)

BOSS STAT CHANGES:

Vampires, Vampire Ancients, and Alternate Dragonlings will do much less than stated dmg if player is a Vampire
"avg dmg/atk" accounts for multiple instances of damage per attack animation (from Assassins, Orc Warlords, and Daedra Lords)
"avg dmg/atk" is average dmg monster will inflict in one attack animation
Large Assassin damage nerf now that they bypass Poison Immunity
Large Daedra Lord damage nerf to better match average damage of other bosses
Boss damage scales smoother, likely will have no game impact but I like consistency

Vampire
55-85 dmg
70 avg dmg/atk (-3 nerf)

Lich
60-90 dmg
75 avg dmg/atk

Assassin
39-67 dmg
106 avg dmg/atk (-40 nerf)
-8 Armor (It was -16 in v1.1 due to my error)

Alternate Dragonling
95-125 dmg
110 avg dmg/atk (+5 buff)

Orc Warlord
42-73 dmg
115 avg dmg/atk (+5 buff)

Daedra Lord
30-60 dmg
120 avg dmg/atk (-40 nerf)

Vampire Ancient
110-140 dmg
125 avg dmg/atk (-3 nerf)

Ancient Lich
115-145 dmg
130 avg dmg/atk (-5 nerf)

COMBAT:

Gauntlet/boot material affects player's Hand-to-Hand to-hit roll, scales just like vanilla weapon materials
Gauntlet material affects player's punch to-hit, boot material affects player's kick to-hit
Leather/Chain/Steel/Silver do not alter player's to-hit
Successful Hand-to-Hand attacks damage player's glove/boot durability based on if attack is punch/kick
Silver gauntlets/boots will damage Ghosts/Wraiths/Werewolves/etc. if player is using Hand-to-Hand
If you're wearing silver gauntlets you must use punch attacks to damage Ghosts/Wraiths/etc.
If you're wearing silver boots you must use kick attacks to damage Ghosts/Wraiths/etc.

COMBAT MECHANICS:

I don't want non-sentient or stupid enemies to retreat, so these enemies always charge:

Rat
Giant Bat
Grizzly Bear
Sabertooth Tiger
Spider
Slaughterfish
Skeletal Warrior
Giant
Zombie
Ghost
Mummy
Giant Scorpion
Gargoyle
Wraith
Barbarian

Archers/Rangers never move in to attack if they can see player, always retreat, player must rush them
Archer/Ranger movespeed nerfed to reduce annoyance factor when rushing them
None of these changes apply if Enhanced Combat AI is disabled

DISEASE/POISON:

Bossfall v1.1 incorrectly stated a rare spider/scorpion poison bypassed Poison Immunity when it did not
This has been corrected, spider/scorpion has 0.1%/hit of inflicting Drothweed that bypasses Poison Immunity
Spider/Giant Scorpion poison chance nerfed to 10% per hit, I fixed buggy Spider/Scorpion poison formula
Non-boss poisoned weapons will not bypass Resistance or Immunity
Moved non-boss poisoned weapon chance back to vanilla 5%

DUNGEON ENCOUNTER TABLES:

Centaurs aren't in any dungeons, Imps are never found outside dungeons (I forgot to add this to v1.1 changelog)
Every encounter table has been rewritten, no longer using any code from Jay_H's "Unleveled Mobs"

Human Stronghold - Sorcerers removed, replaced with Mages
Prison - Mages removed, replaced with Sorcerers
Desecrated Temple - Barbarians/Harpies added, less Daedra Seducers/Giant Bats
Natural Cave - Sabertooth Tigers removed, more Rats
Crypt - Sabertooth Tigers/Grizzly Bears/Spiders removed, more Skeletons/Zombies/Mummies
Orc Stronghold - more Orc Sergeants/Orc Shamans, less Orcs
Spider Nest - Ghosts added, less Mummies
Barbarian Stronghold - Harpies added, slightly less Barbarians
Cemetery - Added Ghosts (they're rare), less Giant Bats
Underwater - Added Ghosts & Wraiths (they're very rare), less Lamias and Ice Atronachs, more Skeletons
Default building - every human enemy, vermin, Assassin boss
Guildhall - every human enemy, vermin, Alternate Dragonling boss
Temple - every human enemy, vermin, Orc Warlord boss
Palace, House 1 - every human enemy, vermin, Daedra Lord boss
House 2 - every human enemy, vermin, Vampire boss
House 3 - every human enemy, vermin, Ancient Lich boss

ENEMIES:

Human enemies are unleveled once player hits Level 7, 2 levels higher than v1.1 (this includes Guards. HALT!)
Human enemies switch to Hand-to-Hand if that's more damaging than their weapon
Thus, human enemies do much more damage at higher levels (they switch to H2H around enemy level 5)
I thought this H2H check was already in v1.1 but I read the formula wrong
In v1.1 I applied human enemy armor incorrectly, armor did not scale with their level
This has been corrected, human enemies have 4 armor @ Level 1 (slightly better than Imp armor), scales up to -4 armor @ Level 20 (slightly worse than Daedra Seducer armor)
Bards pacified by Etiquette, Barbarians/Rangers by Streetwise
Using Hand-to-Hand against Fire Atronachs/Fire Daedra damages player (if in wereform player won't take dmg)
If using Enhanced Combat AI enemy move speed will not be reduced while enemy is melee attacking

ENEMY STAT CHANGES:

No longer using any stats from Ralzar's "Meaner Monsters"

Rat
7 Armor (+1 buff)

Spriggan
6 Armor (+1 buff)

Giant Bat
5 Armor (-1 nerf)

Grizzly Bear

Lamia
0 Armor (-2 nerf)

GAMEPLAY:

Building identification in "Info" mode range doubled
Removed the check I put in for switching to Hand-to-Hand if player can't be harmed by enemy's weapon, that check already exists in vanilla DFU code
Shortened most HUD messages when attacking enemies that are immune to your weapon for brevity's sake
After a successful Pickpocket skill check on a human enemy or townsperson, 10% of the time you'll pilfer up to 100 gold pieces, 90% of the time you'll find nothing
Thus, Pickpocketing is 3.3 times more profitable (I never liked how pointless it was in vanilla)
Regardless of whether you find any gold, a successful Pickpocket check will count toward your Thieves Guild initiation letter

ITEMS:

Material generation chances fixed, Daedric possible from any enemy, store, or loot pile, not just high level enemies (major oops)
Rebalanced weapon durabilities, all weapon types use same scale (If you're using RPR:I that'll overwrite a few weapon durabilities)
Daggers have greater durability, bows slightly more, Long Blades/Axes/Blunt Weapons much less
No longer using any item stats from Hazelnut & Ralzar's "Roleplay and Realism: Items"
Changed a few miscellaneous item stats/weights

LOOT:

Gauntlets are now generated as regular enemy equipment (if using RPR:I this change will be hard to notice)
Changed high tier material chances - non-boss human enemies and Daedra will drop somewhat less good loot
High level bosses (anything other than Liches & Vampires) will drop significantly more Daedric
If using RPR:I Cemetery loot piles won't contain armor/weapons (Cemeteries were too profitable w/RPR:I)
If not using RPR:I Cemetery loot piles are now more profitable

LYCANTHROPY:

Transforming into werewolf/wereboar no longer restores player to maximum health
If in wereform equipped gloves/boots aren't damaged and don't give +to-hit bonuses to Hand-to-Hand attacks
If in wereform player can damage enemies that are normally immune to Hand-to-Hand

MAGIC ITEMS:

Holy Water, Holy Daggers, and Holy Tomes cast Dispel Undead/Undead/Daedra on use, have 1/3/3 charges
Holy items generate as normal in high quality Pawn Shops and as random loot from enemies, loot piles and house containers
They will not dispel Undead/Daedra 100% of the time, success rate depends on player level (just like regular Dispel spells)
Most useless magic item effects replaced, some names changed
"Item of Teleportation" has Recall as Cast When Used power
Pacify Undead/Humanoid/Animal & Charm added as Cast When Used powers (in case player can't outrun a boss)
Dispel Magic is now a Potion, recipes spawn normally (so player can get rid of Continuous Damage effects)
Potions of Restore Power restore 50 Magicka, doesn't scale w/player level
Regular magic items found as loot or in stores will never be Holy Water, Holy Daggers, or Holy Tomes

NON-DUNGEON ENCOUNTER TABLES (completely reworked for v1.2):

Mountain Woods use Mountain spawn tables in town at night and in wilderness during the day, use new, unique encounter table in wilderness at night
Swamps use Rainforest encounter tables

SHOPS:

Reduced overall item generation chances in shops, shop quality now has huge impact on what's available
Fancy clothing and other expensive-looking items are only in high quality shops
Cuirasses, gauntlets, tower shields, and best-in-slot weapons are not in low quality shops
If using RPR:I you will find Wakazashis, Katanas & Dai-Katanas in low quality shops
Shops of average quality or better that are not libraries or bookstores will stock far fewer books
Shops below average quality (sturdy shelves, rusty relics) that are not libraries or bookstores will never stock books
General stores stock less armor, Booksellers stock lots more books

SKILLS:

Medical/Stealth/Running/Orcish/Harpy/Giantish/Daedric easier to level
All weapons/spells/Dodging/Critical Strike easier to level
Backstabbing much easier to level
Etiquette/Streetwise are exercised with human enemies even if you don't pacify them
